<p>These are some requirements for 'Fruity approved' plugins. You're free to build 
  your Fruity plugins whatever way you want, but we will only support such 'system 
  friendly' plugins.<br>
  <br>
  Plugins that don't respect all those rules could be seen as working (or not 
  crashing so often) plugins, but in no way 'nice' to the system. Keep in mind 
  that most of the users will see FL Studio crashing instead of the plugin crashing. 
</p>
<p><i>A Fruity plugin should:</i></p>
<p><b>Share most of its resources between each instance of the same plugin</b><br>
  That is, a plugin shouldn't recreate all its bitmaps or lenghty precalculated 
  tables each time an instance of it is recreated. Instead it should create all 
  its resources in its DLL startup code, &amp; let each instance of the plugin 
  class access the same ressources (if possible). This is important in order to 
  lower the minimum memory requirement for &amp; its plugins, but also very important 
  because graphic resources (handles) are <em>very</em> limited under Win9x, &amp; 
  opening 8 times a plugin that eats 10% graphic resources (&amp; doesn't share 
  them) would crash the system. FL Studio itself now eats about 10% of the graphic 
  resources, but used to eat over 30% in its early versions. The trick here is 
  to prefer DIBs (*not* using CreateDIBSection that eats a handle too) over DDBs, 
  &amp; to group bitmaps if possible.</p>
<p><b>Not eat too much CPU for what it does</b><br>
  A plugin eating 20% of the average CPU is almost useless, unless it's not made 
  to be used in a complete song. Don't create any threaded timer, FL Studio itself 
  uses standard Windows timers for its animation, because it's a music app &amp; 
  the music has a higher priority. Threaded timers are only used for the mixer 
  &amp; MIDI message delivering. Any timer used to animate something should be 
  switched off when the interface is hidden.</p>
<p><b>Install nicely</b><br>
  In the tools folder, you can find the FPSetup program. You can call this from 
  your installer program (or unzipper or whatever), with a script file as parameter. 
  This will then install your plugin in the right place. Look <a href="installation.html">here</a> 
  for additional information about this. </p>
<p><b>Not be published in its beta state</b><br>
  This not to crowd the plugin list with ten versions of the same plugin 
  (though a second or enhanced version is acceptable). Plugin presets are definitely 
  *not* compatible between them, so an enhanced version of a plugin won't be 'told' 
  to load presets from another version, which is considered as another plugin. 
  A better way to support future enhancements is to store a version # as the first 
  entry in the plugin saved state. That way, any enhanced version will be the 
  same plugin (same name, &amp; overwriting its old version), &amp; check the 
  version stored in its state to 'adapt' old presets to its new version. It's 
  also nice, though not required, to make the plugin not load a state of a version 
  it doesn't support.</p>
<p><b>Have a name that works as a valid directory name</b><br>
  Plugins will store their 
  presets inside a subdirectory of the same name, so plugins can't use \ or any 
  invalid character in their name. Additionally (but it's more a limitation), 
  the plugin 'long' name (published by the DLL), the plugin DLL name, &amp; its 
  subdirectory name should be the *same*. Ex: 'BeepMap/BeepMap.dll' publishes 
  the name 'BeepMap' (but is free to publish anything else as the 'short' name).</p>
<p><b>Have a unique name</b><br>
  Please do not name it 'Flanger', or just 'Distortion' of course. We're not using 
  GUIDs to recognise plugins, so plugin names have to be unique. A good idea is 
  to put your initials before the name &amp; to check that no plugin already has 
  the name you chose. Several DX plugins chose to name their plugin 'AUTHOR plugin 
  function', so that they're easy to store in sub-entries in a menu list. FL Studio 
  might support that in the future.</p>
<p><b>Follow all the rules described in the SDK</b><br>
  The SDK publishes many things not supported yet, so please don't assume your 
  plugin works by trials/errors. Do not touch things or use flags you don't know 
  about.</p>
<p><b>NOT MESS WITH THE CPU STATE</b><br>
  This is important &amp; is part of the bad reputation &amp; instability of VST 
  &amp; DX plugs in FL Studio. Plugins shouldn't modify the CPU state (including 
  the FPU state), or at least restore it as they got it.</p>
<p><b>Respect the guidelines about when plugin functions are called</b><br>
  FL Studio can call plugin functions by its main thread, or the mixing thread, 
  meaning that 2 of your functions could be executing at the same time. For example, 
  your DLL could be mixing a piece of buffer in another (FL Studio) thread just 
  when you're updating a parameter (by one of your visual control), so in some 
  cases a thread synchronisation system has to be used. The FL Studio host class 
  publishes 2 functions to 'lock' &amp; 'unlock' the mixer thread.<br>
