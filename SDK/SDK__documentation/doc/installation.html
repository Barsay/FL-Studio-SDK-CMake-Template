<p><b>General</b><br>
  FL Studio plugins have to be installed in subfolders of the FL Studio\Plugins\Fruity 
  folder. Effect plugins have to be placed in the Effects subfolder, generators 
  have to go into the Generators subfolder.<br>
  <br>
  Plugins must be placed within their own subfolder of either the Effects or Generators 
  folder. This folder has to have the same name as the plugin dll. For example, 
  a gain plugin file with the name Wawza.dll would be placed inside the <font color="#990000">Plugins\Fruity\Effects\Wawza</font> 
  folder. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Installer</b><br>
  The FruityPlug sdk includes an installer tool. In the bin folder, you can find 
  the FPSetup.exe file. This is meant to be called from the program you use to 
  unarchive (unzip, unrar or whatever) your plugin files. For example, it's possible 
  to configure the WinZip self extracting archives to run a program when the extraction 
  is complete. Alternatively, you could include FPSetup.exe in a zip file and 
  tell the user to run it (although the first option is nicer to the user).<br>
  <br>
  FPSetup takes some effort out of the hands of the plugin developer (you) because 
  it looks for the folder where FL Studio is installed. Take care : FPSetup is 
  designed to work with FruityLoops 3 and FL Studio 4.x and higher, not with any 
  2.x version. It won't find the FL Studio folder for any 2.x version of FL Studio.<br>
  <br>
  The files to be installed have to be put in a folder inside the folder where 
  FPSetup.exe is located. So, for a plugin with name Wawza.dll, you would have 
  a folder with the name Wawza inside your archive. <br>
  <br>
  Optionally, you can include presets to be installed by FPSetup. These have to 
  be put in a subfolder called Presets (so Wawza\Presets for the Wawza.dll example). 
  <br>
  You can also have files copied into a location relative to the base FL Studio 
  folder. To do this, put those files in a subfolder called Fruityloops (so Wawza\Fruityloops 
  for the Wawza.dll example).
<p>We do advise using a proper installer for plugins. The free <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">NSIS</a> 
  program works very well and can be extended to do just about anything very easily.<br>
  <br>
  <b>The script</b><br>
  FPSetup requires a script file to know what it has to do. <br>
  If no parameter is provided on the commandline, it assumes the script file is 
  called &quot;fpsetup.scr&quot;. You can also instruct it to use an other file 
  by calling FPSetup like this : &nbsp;&quot;fpsetup -f scriptfile.scr&quot; (without 
  the &quot; characters). <br>
  The content of the scriptfile is very simple. You can look at the fruitymonitor.scr 
  file in the tools folder for an example. <br>
  <br>
  There are two lines that are required in a script file : 
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">PluginName = Dll Name
Type = Plugin Type</font> </pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Make sure there is at least one space at each side of the = character. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Type</i> can be either Effect or Generator. This tells FPSetup whether it 
  has to install the plugin in Plugins\Fruity\Effects or Plugins\Fruity\Generators. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>PluginName</i> has to be the name of the plugin dll, without the .dll extension.<br>
  <br>
  There can also be comments in the file. Everything on a line after a double 
  slash ( // ) or a single quote ( ' ) is considered a comment. 
<p><b>Examples</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Contents of a script file for an effect plugin with filename Wawza.dll 
    <table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
      <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
        <td><pre><font color="#3333FF">PluginName = Wawza
Type = Effect</font></pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Contents of a script file for a generator plugin with filename Wohow.dll 
    <table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
      <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
        <td> 
          <pre><font color="#3333FF">PluginName = Wohow<br>Type = Generator</font></pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
