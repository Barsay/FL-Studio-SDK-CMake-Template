<p>There are a few examples included in the sdk. On these pages, they are described 
  step by step. For each plugin, there's a Delphi and a C++ page.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FruityGain</b> is an effect plugin. </li>
  <li><b>Osc3</b> is an generator plugin. It's a full generator, which means that 
    it implements Gen_Render. If it had been a hybrid generator, it would have 
    implemented Voice_Render instead.</li>
  <li><b>Internal Controller</b> is also an effect plugin. It doesn't process 
    any sound, but instead it allows you to control other controls (in FL Studio).</li>
  <li><b>Sine</b> is a simple plugin that plays a sine wave. It demonstrates how 
    to implement per-voice level and pan and slides.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FruityGain pages contain the most information. The Osc3 and Sine pages 
  assume you've read the FruityGain pages and build on from that knowledge, only 
  explaining the things specific to a generator plugin.</p>
<p>There's no written documentation for the Internal Controller example yet (except 
  for the comments in the sourcecode).</p>
<p>Note that these examples are quite old and don't show recent features.</p>
