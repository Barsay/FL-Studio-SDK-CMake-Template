<p>This page contains a run-through of the FruityGain header and source files. 
  Because this is meant to be a tutorial for all C++ compilers (most notably C++Builder 
  and Visual C++), all compiler-specific lines have comments stating what is going 
  on instead of source code. There's no explanation yet for the implementation 
  of the editor window.</p>
<p><a name="_gain_h"></a><b>Gain.h</b><br>
  This is the header file that contains the plugin class definition. <br>
  <br>
  First we have the include section.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here we include some sdk headers (fp_plugclass.h and fp_cplug.h). <br>
  <br>
  Next we define some useful constants. This is not necessary, but it can make 
  life a lot easier when you start changing these values. FruityGain has a seperate 
  gain value for the left and right channels, so we have two parameters. There 
  are also a minimum and maximum value defined.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">

const GainMinimum = 0;
const GainMaximum = 20;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We're now ready to declare the plugin class. Note that we're deriving from 
  TCPPFruityPlug. This class implements some useful functions so it's not a bad 
  idea to derive from this instead of TFruityPlug. For example, TCPPFruityPlug 
  implements DestroyObject in order to delete the object, so you don't have to 
  do this anymore. <br>
  <br>
  Here we first have some variables in which we store the parameter values (GainLeftInt, 
  GainRightInt, GainLeft, GainRight). We have both integer and floating point 
  variables for this. The integer variables are for communication with the editor 
  controls (which use integers) and the floating point ones are for calculations 
  in Eff_Render (so we don't have to calculate them every time Eff_Render is called).</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">class TFruityGain : public TCPPFruityPlug {

};</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Then we define a constructor. This has one parameter, Tag, that is passed on 
  from the host. We'll get back to this when we discuss the implementation of 
  the constructor. We could also have overridden DestroyObject if we wanted to 
  do something special when that is called by FL Studio. But since we derive 
  from TDelphiFruityPlug, DestroyObject is already implemented to free the object, 
  so we don't need to do that anymore.<br>
  The rest of the functions defined will be discussed when we reach their implementation. 
  Just a little note here that GainIntToSingle and ResetParams are helper functions 
  for this specific plugin, so they probably won't be present in your own plugins.</p>

</table>
<p>We declare a new variable of type TFruityPlugInfo. This record will be read 
  by FL Studio later on to find out what kind of plugin this is. We set <b>SDKVersion</b> 
  to the constant value CurrentSDKVersion, so FL Studio knows what we expect 
  from it. <br>
  We also set <b>LongName</b> to the name of the dll, without the .dll extension. 
  The name of the dll should be as unique as possible. So simply &quot;Gain&quot; 
  would have been a bad name, whereas &quot;XFIGOEJSL&quot; might be a good unique 
  name, but probably not very nice to the user. You might use something like &quot;Ralfs 
  Gain&quot; for example as the name of your plugin, which would make it reasonably 
  unique.<br>
  <b>ShortName</b> can be anything you want, but it should also be as unique as 
  possible. It also shouldn't be very long (as the name suggests).<br>
  <b>Flags</b> actually defines what kind of plugin we're creating. We're making 
  an effect plugin, so we use FPF_Type_Effect. There are some other flags you 
  can use here too (see <a href="../constants.html#_pluginflags">Plugin Flag Constants</a>).<br>
  We tell FL Studio how many parameters we have in <b>NumParams</b>. We also 
  set <b>DefPoly</b> to 0, as we're creating an effect plugin.</p>
<p>We begin by implementing CreatePlugInstance. First we assign Host to the global 
  variable PlugHost. This is necessary, as some functions in TDelphiFruityPlug 
  expect it to be there. Then we create our plugin object and pass it back to 
  FL Studio as the result of the function.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that we're exporting the function from the dll (using _declspec(dllexport)) 
  and it's declared _stdcall. Also it's declared using extern &quot;C&quot;, which 
  prevents name mangling.</p>
<p>Now we reach the implementation of the constructor. The first thing we do of 
  course is call the inherited constructor. <br>
  We also assign the address of the PlugInfo variable we declared earlier to the 
  Info member of TFruityPlug. This way, FL Studio knows where to find it.<br>
  Then we assign the Tag parameter (passed by CreatePlugInstance) to the HostTag 
  member, so we can use it later on. </p>

</table>
<p>We also create our editor form in the constructor.<br>
  Finally, we reset the parameter values. ResetParams is used for this, as resetting 
  the parameters is done from several places.</p>
<p>Next is Dispatcher. This function passes messages from FL Studio to the plugin. 
  These are identified by the ID parameter (for a list of all values, see <a href="../constants.html#_dispatcherid">Dispatcher 
  ID's</a>). The Index and Value parameters have different meanings, depending 
  on the value of ID.</p>

    return 0;
}</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here we implement a reaction to the FPD_ShowEditor message. This tells us that 
  FL Studio wants the editor window to be either hidden or shown, depending 
  on the value of Value. Value holds the parent window we have to use to show 
  our editor window. <br>
  So if Value is zero, we hide the window, and then we set the parent window to 
  zero. <br>
  If Value is not zero, we assign it to ParentWindow for our editor, and then 
  we show the editor. <br>
  Note that the order of these things is important. If ParentWindow is zero while 
  the editor window is already or still shown, the user will see it floating on 
  the screen, which doesn't make a good impression.<br>
  Finally we set TFruityPlug's EditorHandle member to the handle of our editor 
  window. </p>
<p> Eff_Render is the core of an effect plugin. It gets called continuously to 
  process data while the plugin is active. <br>
  Data is to be read from SourceBuffer, processed, and written to DestBuffer. 
  These two parameters point to a buffer of interlaced samples. Interlaced means 
  that the samples for the two channels (left and right) are mixed together. So 
  first you get the first left sample, then the first right sample, then the second 
  left sample and so on. <br>
  Note that SourceBuffer and DestBuffer could point to the same buffer, so it 
  might be worth checking for this to save some time.<br>
  The PWAV32FS type makes it easy to work with these buffers, as shown in below.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">void _stdcall TFruityGain::Eff_Render(PWAV32FS SourceBuffer, PWAV32FS DestBuffer, int Length)
{
   float left, right;

   left = GainLeft;
   right = GainRight;

   for (int i = 0; i < Length; i++)
   {
        (*DestBuffer)[i][0] = (*SourceBuffer)[i][0] * left;
        (*DestBuffer)[i][1] = (*SourceBuffer)[i][1] * right;
   }
}</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We first assign GainLeft and GainRight to some local variables, in case they 
  change while we're processing.<br>
  Then we run through the buffers, each time multiplying the channel's gain with 
  the current sample. As you can see, Length specifies the number of samples in 
  each channel, not the total amount of samples in the buffer.</p>
<p>GainIntToSingle is a function specific to this plugin. It translates the integer 
  parameter values (from the editor controls) to floating point values. What's 
  important here is that we lock and unlock the mixing threads, to make sure that 
  this doesn't happen from two threads at the same time, or that other functions 
  that depend on these values are called from a different thread. It's probably 
  a bit overkill in this example, but it shows how to do it.</p>

</table>
<p>Next is the implementation of GetName. This procedure is called by FL Studio 
  when it wants a string representation of some value. What it wants translated 
  is specified by the Section parameter (see <a href="../constants.html#_getname">GetName 
  constants</a>). The meanings of Index and Value depend on the value of Section. 
  Name points to a buffer that you have to put the translated string into. The 
  memory for Name is assigned by FL Studio, so you don't need to worry about 
  this. There's room for at least 256 characters in Name.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">void _stdcall TFruityGain::GetName(int Section, int Index, int Value, char *Name)
{
    if (Section == FPN_Param)
    {
        switch (Index) {
            case prmGainLeft  :  strcpy(Name, "Left Gain");  break;
            case prmGainRight :  strcpy(Name, "Right Gain");  break;
        }
    }
    else if (Section == FPN_ParamValue)
    {
        float tempfloat = (Value / 4.) + 1;
        sprintf(Name, "%.2fx", tempfloat);
    }
}</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> </tr>
</table>
<p>We check for two Section values here : FPN_Param (a parameter name is required) 
  and FPN_ParamValue (a parameter value is to be translated). In both cases, Index 
  tells us what parameter FL Studio is talking about. In the case of FPN_ParamValue, 
  Value holds the value to be translated. Don't use your own internal values for 
  this, since it's not always the current value that has to be translated.</p>
<p>Next is the Idle procedure. You can use this to perform some action when the 
  user isn't doing anything. <br>
  In the C++Builder example, we do something very nice which you might want to 
  implement in your own plugins as well. We check whether the mouse is over a 
  control (on our editor form of course) and tell FL Studio to show a hint message. 
  (Not in the Visual C++ examples, sorry)</p>

<p>Now we come to the ProcessParam function. This is a bit complicated, so I'll 
  split it up into several parts.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">int _stdcall TFruityGain::ProcessParam(int Index, int Value, int RECFlags)

    if (Index < NumParams)
    {
        if (RECFlags & REC_FromMIDI != 0)
            Value = TranslateMidi(Value, GainMinimum, GainMaximum); </font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>First we check whether Index actually identifies a valid parameter. <br>
  Then we start checking the flags present in RECFlags. The order in which we 
  check these is important. We start by checking for REC_FromMIDI. This means 
  that Value holds a value between 0 and 65536, that needs to be translated to 
  the range for our parameter. How this happens depends on the minimum and maximum 
  values of the individual parameters. Since our parameters have the same minimum 
  and maximum, we don't need to check Index. TCPPFruityPlug provides the function 
  TranslateMIDI, so you don't need to implement this yourself. <br>
  <br>
  Next we check whether we need to change the value of a parameter to a new value 
  or return a parameter value to FL Studio.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>

            GainIntToSingle();
        }</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If RECFlags includes REC_UpdateValue, we need to change a parameter's value. 
  So we check Index to see which parameter we have to change and set the value. 
  In this example, GainIntToSingle is called to also set the floating point values.<br>
  Note that we're not changing the controls on the editor window yet. That's for 
  a bit later.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">

</table>
<p>If REC_GetValue is in RECFlags, FL Studio expects us to return the value 
  of a parameter as the result of the function. This flag cannot be present when 
  REC_UpdateValue is present, so we use an if .. then .. else construct. We look 
  at Index to know which parameter FL Studio is talking about and change Value 
  to the integer value of the parameter.</p>

  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF">

<p>The final check we make is for REC_UpdateControl. When this is not present, 
  don't update the editor window's controls ! If it is, update the control for 
  this parameter.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the function, we assign Value to Result. It's safe to always do 
  this, regardless of whether or not REC_GetValue is present in RECFlags.</p>
<p>Time to move on to the next function.</p>

<p>ResetParams is an internal function to reset the parameters to their default 
  values. Here, we also call GainIntToSingle to set the floating point variables 
  and update the editor window's controls afterwards.</p>
<p>Then comes SaveRestoreState. This function allows the plugin to write its state 
  to and read it from a stream, which could be a file, or memory, or whatever. 
  The Save parameter tells us whether FL Studio expects the plugin to save or 
  restore.<br>
  The Stream parameter is of type IStream. You can use this just like any object. 
  There are several functions available in IStream, but the most important are 
  Write and Read. One thing to watch out for, is that you have to read the exact 
  same amount of data from the stream as was written to this. For simple plugins, 
  you can do this simply by reading and writing the same data. For more complex 
  plugins, it might be necessary to first write the amount of data you're going 
  to write, or some sort of version number, so that you never make a mistake.</p>

<p>First we check Save, so we know what to do. IStream.Write and IStream.Read 
  work similarly. The first parameter is a pointer to the data to write away. 
  Here we pass the address of the integer parameter variables using the &amp; 
  operator. The second parameter is the size of the data to be written, which 
  we find by using sizeof. The last parameter is a pointer to a long. In the case 
  of Write, this will hold the number of bytes which were actually written to 
  the stream. In the case of Read, this will hold the number of bytes actually 
  read from the stream. After reading, we also update the parameters and controls 
  by calling GainIntToSingle and ProcessAllParams.</p>
