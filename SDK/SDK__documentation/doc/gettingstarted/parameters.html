<p>Fruity plugins can have parameters. The amount of parameters a plugin can have 
  is not limited. It could be zero, 1, 2, 1000, ... . Note however that there 
  is a limit on the number of parameters FL will show to the user (currently 4096).</p>
<p> For FL Studio to be able to know how many parameters a plugin has, the plugin 
  needs to set the NumParams member of its TFruityPlugInfo structure to the amount 
  of parameters. This field is a maximum, which you can override by calling the 
  host dispatcher function with the id <font color="#990000">FHD_SetNumParams</font>.<br>
  <br>
  There are several functions that apply to parameters: GetName, ProcessParam 
  and SaveRestoreState. There are also a couple of other funcions that have to 
  do with parameters in the host class (see <a href="host.html">Talking to the 
  host</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>GetName</b><br>
  FL Studio calls GetName when it wants something expressed in a user-readable 
  string. The Section parameter specifies what exactly the host wants a string 
  for. For the moment, there are four possible values for Section : FPN_Param, 
  FPN_ParamValue, FPN_Semitone and FPN_Patch. The Text paramer is a pointer to 
  a string (pchar / char *) that will hold the string representation.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from FPN_Param, the GetName sections are all optional. You can support 
  them if you want to, but it's not necessary.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_Param</font> means the function should put the name 
  of the parameter in Text. Index specifies which parameter.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_ParamValue</font> means that the function should translate 
  a value of a parameter to a string. Index specifies which parameter, Value is 
  the value to be translated. This is used by FL Studio in the event editor to 
  show something different from 0..100%<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_Semitone</font> is not about parameters. It is called 
  when FL Studio wants a string representation of a note (for in the piano roll). 
  This is meant for drum machines, that have a different name for each note. Index 
  specifies which note is to be translated.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_Patch</font> is not used yet.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_VoiceLevel</font> is used to get the names of the 
  per-voice parameters.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_VoiceLevelHint</font> can be nice if you also want 
  to specify a longer description of a per-voice parameter.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_Preset</font> is used to determine the names of the 
  plugin's internal presets (if any). Most Fruity plugins don't have internal 
  presets, as it's very easy to just provide an .fst preset. The latter one will 
  also show up in the sample browser, so it might be more convenient for the user.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPN_OutCtrl</font> is called for plugins that export internal 
  controllers. You can (must) provide a name for the specified controller.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>ProcessParam</b><br>
  ProcessParam gets called when some parameter has changed or when FL Studio wants 
  the value of a parameter. The plugin itself can also call this function if it 
  wants to. Take a good look at the ProcessParam function in the demos. The order 
  in which things are done there should be respected.<br>
  <br>
  Index holds the parameter index and Value holds a new value (if the value has 
  to be changed).<br>
  <br>
  RECFlags tells you what has to be done. It's a bitfield (see <a href="../bitfields.html">Working 
  with bitfields</a>). It can hold a combination of <a href="../constants.html#_processparam">ProcessParam 
  flags</a>. The order in which you handle the different flags is important (see 
  the examples for more info). There are at the moment 5 flags that a plugin has 
  to respond to.<br>
  <br>
  First, you need to check if <font color="#660000">REC_FromMIDI</font> is included. 
  If it is, this means that the Value parameter contains a value between 0 and 
  65536. This Value then needs to be translated to fall in the range that the 
  plugin uses for the parameter. For this reason, TDelphiFruityPlug and TCPPFruityPlug 
  implement the function TranslateMidi. You pass it Value and the minimum and 
  maximum value of your parameter, and it returns the right value.<br>
  REC_FromMIDI is really important and has to be supported by the plugin. It is 
  not just used by FL Studio to provide you with a new parameter value, but also 
  to determine the minimum and maximum values for a parameter.<br>
  <br>
  Then check whether either <font color="#660000">REC_UpdateValue</font> or <font color="#660000">REC_GetValue</font> 
  are included. These two flags can never be present at the same time. <br>
  <br>
  In the case of <font color="#660000">REC_UpdateValue</font>, Value holds the 
  new parameter value. You should of course check for REC_FromMidi and adjust 
  the Value when necessary (see above). This flag could be specified both when 
  the function is being called from the mixer thread as when it's called from 
  the main thread.<br>
  Be ware : you should not update the control for the parameter yet. Only when 
  <font color="#660000">REC_UpdateControl</font> is specified as well should the 
  control be updated. This is for performance reasons. REC_UpdateControl is guaranteed 
  to only be called from the main thread, so it shouldn't be a problem if you 
  update the control without locking the threads.<br>
  <br>
  Also pay attention to <font color="#660000">REC_InternalCtrl</font> if your 
  plugin exports controllers, in order to avoid feedback of internal controller 
  changes. <br>
  <br>
  If <font color="#660000">REC_GetValue</font> is included, you have to return 
  the current value of the parameter as the result of the function. This means 
  you should return the value that your plugin uses, not the one that is provided 
  in Value.<br>
  If REC_GetValue is not included, you have to return the Value parameter as the 
  result of your function. Of course, when REC_FromMIDI is present you first need 
  to translate Value (see above).<br>
  <br>
  The plugin doesn't have to react to the <font color="#660000">REC_ShowHint</font> 
  flag. If it does, the plugin should either tell FL Studio to show a hint (see 
  <a href="host.html">Talking to the host</a>) or show a hint on its own. However, 
  if this flag is not included, the plugin should definitely not show a hint from 
  ProcessParam. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">REC_PlugReserved</font> can be used internally for your 
  plugin. FL Studio definitely won't ever use this value.<br>
  <br>
  Look at the examples to see exactly what should happen when each of these flags 
  is included in RECFlags.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>SaveRestoreState</b><br>
  This function gets called to save and restore the state (mostly parameters normally) 
  of a plugin. For example, the FL Studio custom preset mechanism uses this function.<br>
  <br>
  This is a very simple function. The boolean Save parameter specifies whether 
  the plugin has to save (Save=true) or restore (Save=false) the state.<br>
  <br>
  The Stream parameter (a pointer to an IStream object) can then be used to actually 
  read or write the state. It has a Write function that takes three parameters: 
  a pointer to the variable being saved, the size of what is being saved and finally 
  a pointer to a variable that will receive the total number of bytes saved. The 
  Read function works the same way (but the last parameter receives the number 
  of bytes that were read). For a full explanation of IStream, see the Windows 
  API help files.</p>
<p>One thing to make sure when implementing this function, is that exactly the 
  same amount of data is read from the stream as was previously written to it. 
  If you don't do this, there's no telling what may go wrong as further reading 
  from the stream will return the wrong data ! So it would be a good idea to first 
  write a version number (if your plugin's implementation might change in the 
  future) and the length of the block you're going to write (so it can be skipped 
  if unknown).</p>
