<p>There are four ways the host will inform the plugin of something it has to 
  do or something that has happened. These are Dispatcher, Idle, ProcessEvent 
  and Voice_ProcessEvent. The last one is discussed on the page <a href="voices.html">Working 
  with voices</a>.</p>
<p><b>Dispatcher</b><br>
  Depending on ID, the plugin needs to do something. ID can be one of the <a href="../constants.html#_dispatcherid">Dispatcher 
  IDs</a>.<br>
  <br>
  When ID is <font color="#660000">FPD_ShowEditor</font>, the plugin has to either 
  show or hide its editor window. If Value is zero, the editor has to be hidden. 
  Otherwise, the editor has to be shown. In this case, Value is the handle of 
  the parent window, so don't forget to set the parent handle of your window to 
  it. It's best to first set the parent handle and only then show the window. 
  Likewise, hide the editor before you set its parent handle to zero. <br>
  In case the editor has to be hidden, the examples set the parent handle of the 
  editor window to zero. Some development systems (such as Delphi 3) might not 
  like this. In this case, it might be a good idea to save the original value 
  of the parent handle and restore that when the editor is hidden.<br>
  <br>
  If ID is <font color="#660000">FPD_ProcessMode</font>, then Value holds the 
  new processing mode. This ID can be ignored. It's a bitfield that determines 
  the quality of the data that the plugin renders. If the PM_IsRendering flag 
  is set, the host is rendering to a file (.wav, .mp3, ...), which means that 
  the plugin doesn't have to render in real time. You can also check against the 
  PM_IPMask bit mask. This determines the interpolation quality to be used.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_Flush</font> warns the plugin that the next samples 
  do not follow immediately in time to the previous block of samples. In other 
  words, the continuity is broken. You have to make sure that your plugin responds 
  well to a change in continuity. For example, a delay plugin will have to make 
  sure it doesn't use any more old data. The idea is not that you go setting all 
  buffers to zero. It might be enough to set a position variable. This should 
  all be as optimized as possible.<br>
  <br>
  As the name suggests, <font color="#660000">FPD_SetBlockSize</font> tells the 
  plugin that the maximum block size has changed. This is not relevant to all 
  plugins. Value holds the new maximum blocksize.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_SetSampleRate</font> tells the plugin that the sample 
  rate has been changed. If you're making a plugin that is affected by this, look 
  in Value for the new samplerate.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_WindowMinMax</font> is sent when the host wants information 
  about the resizing of the plugin's editor window. There are two things it wants 
  to know : the minimum and maximum sizes of the window, and the changes in size 
  when the user drags the borders of the window. <br>
  Index holds a pointer to a rectangle (TRect / RECT). In this rectangle, you 
  need to specify the minimum and maximum sizes of the editor. For the minimum 
  size, use the Left (width) and Top (height) fields. For the maximum size, use 
  the Right (width) and Bottom (height) fields.<br>
  Value holds a pointer to a point structure (TPoint / POINT). In this structure 
  you can specify special values for the steps in resizing the window. <br>
  If you don't want the window to be resizeable, then don't respond to this message.<br>
  <br>
  FL Studio will call dispatcher with <font color="#660000">FPD_KillAVoice</font> 
  when for some reason it thinks the weakest voice should be killed. Maybe the 
  plugin was using too much cpu. Whatever the reason, the plugin should look for 
  the currently active voice that has the lowest volume (on average) and kill 
  it. If it does this, it should return 1 as the functions result.<br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_UseVoiceLevels</font> is sent to determine whether or not a full generator 
  will use the CutOff and Resonance per-voice parameters as they are, use them 
  as different (custom) parameters, or not use them at all. In the second case, 
  the plugin will need to implement a response for GetName when it's called with 
  the section FPN_VoiceLevel, so it can provide names for the custom parameters.<br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_SetPreset</font> is called when the user selects an internal preset. <br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_ChanSampleChanged</font> lets you know that a sample has been loaded into 
  a generator's channel, and now provided to the plugin as a wavetable. This will 
  only be called for a plugin that has specified FPF_GetChanSample as a flag in 
  its info structure. <br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_SetEnabled</font> is called when the plugin is either enabled or disabled 
  by the user.<br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_SetPlaying</font> informs the plugin that FL Studio has either started or 
  stopped playing. <br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_SongPosChanged</font> lets the plugin know that the song position has jumped 
  from one position to another new one, either before or after the previous position. 
  The new position is never just one further than the old position.<br>
  <font color="#660000"> <br>
  FPD_SetTimeSig</font> is called when the time signature has changed. Check out 
  the <a href="../types.html">time signature structure</a> for more information.<font color="#660000"><br>
  <br>
  FPD_CollectFile</font> is used by the host to find out if a plugin has any additional 
  files it would like to see saved, for example when FL Studio exports a project 
  to a zip file. The host keeps calling this until 0 is returned. As long as the 
  plugin has files to save (indicated by the Index parameter), it should pass 
  a pchar / char *, containing the name of the file to be saved, as the result 
  of the function.<br>
  <font color="#660000"><br>
  FPD_SetNumSends</font> lets you know how many send tracks there are. This is 
  a fixed number for the time being, but it could be variable in the future.<font color="#660000"><br>
  <br>
  FPD_LoadFile</font> is called when a file (not a sound file) is dropped onto 
  a channel's button. The plugin can then load this file if it wants to.The Value 
  parameter should be typecast to a pchar / char * variable and holds the name 
  of the file that was dropped.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_SetFitTime</font> sets fit to a time in beats.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_SetSamplesPerTick</font> lets you know how many samples 
  there are in a &quot;tick&quot; (the basic period of time in FL Studio). This 
  changes when the tempo, PPQ or sample rate have changed. This can be called 
  from the mixing thread.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPD_SetIdleTime</font> passes the interval at which the 
  Idle function will be called, in milliseconds. You can use this to adjust things 
  like the speed of an animation.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../constants.html">Constants</a> page for a complete list 
  of dispatcher codes.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Idle</b><br>
  This function is called continuously. It allows the plugin to perform certain 
  tasks that are not time-critical and which do not take up a lot of time either. 
  For example, TDelphiFruityPlug and TCPPFruityPlug implement this function to 
  show a hint message when the mouse moves over a control in the editor.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>ProcessEvent</b><br>
  This is called by the host for special events. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPE_Tempo</font> means that the tempo has changed. Value 
  holds the new tempo. The tempo is a floating point (single / float), so it needs 
  to be typecast from the integer Value, like this :<br>
  <i><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delphi :</font></i> &nbsp;NewTempo 
  := single(Value);<br>
  <font color="#CC0000"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++ :</i></font> &nbsp;NewTempo 
  = *((float *)&Value);<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPE_MaxPoly</font> is only of intrest to full generators. 
  It tells them that the maximum polyphony (the maximum number of voices playing 
  at once) has been changed. A value of zero (0) means unlimited polyphony.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPE_MIDI_Pan</font> let's the plugin know that the midi 
  pan has changed.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPE_MIDI_Vol</font> informs you that the midi volume has 
  changed.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FPE_MIDI_Pitch</font> is used when the midi pitch has 
  changed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../constants.html">Constants</a> page for a complete list 
  of event codes.</p>
