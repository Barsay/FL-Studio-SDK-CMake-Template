  <b>What's in the sdk ?</b><br>
  There are 3 core files in the sdk:<br>
  FP_PlugClass (.pas / .h) contains the structure and class definitions, as well 
  as the <a href="../constants.html">constants</a> required when creating Fruity 
  plugins. <br>
  FP_Def (.pas / .h) contains some types and constants that can be used in your 
  plugins. <br>
  FP_Extra (.pas/.h) has some extra type definitions, constants and functions<br>
  <br>
  There's also a helper class defined, that derives from TFruityPlug and defines 
  some handy functions. This is TDelphiFruityPlug for Delphi (FP_DelphiClass.pas) 
  and TCPPFruityPlug for C++ (FP_CPlug.h). It's best to derive your own plugin 
  class from one of these (depending on the programming language you use). <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>The plugin class</b><br>
  A plugin has to be implemented inside a class. The base class for this is TFruityPlug. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>TFruityPlugInfo</b><br>
  FL Studio gets its information about a plugin from the <a href="../fruitypluginfo.html">TFruityPlugInfo</a> 
  structure. Therefore it's important to know how to fill this in. From this structure, 
  FL Studio retrieves the type of the plugin, whether it supports an editor, what 
  its unique name is and so on.<br>
  <br>
  FL Studio looks for the TFruityPlugInfo in the Info member of <a href="../fruityplug.html">TFruityPlug</a>. 
  This is a pointer to a TFruityPlugInfo structure and it needs to be set by the 
  plugin to point to a valid structure. In the examples this is done in the constructor 
  of the plugin class. <br>
  <br>
  Be sure to always set SDKVersion to CurrentSDKVersion. The plugin name should 
  be as unique as possible (see <a href="../guidelines.html">Guidelines</a>). 
  Also don't forget to set NumParams to the number of parameters your plugin has.<br>
  <br>
  Flags is a bitfield (see <a href="../bitfields.html">Working with bitfields</a>). 
  It contains any combination of <a href="../constants.html#_pluginflags">plugin 
  flags</a>. It can contain a number of flags, some describing the type of plugin 
  (see below). Most of the defined flags are not used yet. See the <a href="../constants.html#_pluginflags">plugin 
  flag constants</a> for a complete list.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Plugin Types</b><br>
  There are two main types of Fruity plugins : effects and generators.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Effects</i> receive audio data from FL Studio. They do something to this 
  data (apply an effect) and give the resulting data back to FL Studio. You specify 
  an effect plugin by leaving out <font color="#660000">FPF_Generator</font> from 
  the Flags member of TFruityPlugInfo. Processing for an effect occurs in Eff_Render 
  (see <a href="processing.html">Processing data</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <i>Generators</i> on the other hand do not receive audio data from FL Studio. 
  They create entirely new data (generate) and send that to the host. To create 
  a generator plugin, include <font color="#660000">FPF_Generator</font> in the 
  Flags member of TFruityPlugInfo. Generators are divided into two more categories 
  : full and hybrid generators. There are shortcut flags for creating full and 
  hybrid generators. To make a full generator, you can use <font color="#660000">FPF_Type_FullGen</font>. 
  For a hybrid generator, you would use <font color="#660000">FPF_Type_HybridGen</font> 
  instead.<br>
  <br>
  Full generators create their audio data when Gen_Render is called (see <a href="processing.html">Processing 
  data</a>). They are responsible for doing everything related to creating the 
  audio data. So they might process their own envelope, for example. The big difference 
  with a hybrid generator is that a full generator has to mix all the voices that 
  were created itself, inside Gen_Render.<br>
  <br>
  Hybrid generators on the other hand implement the Voice_Render function to generate 
  their audio (see <a href="voices.html">Working with voices</a>). A hybrid generator 
  is created by including <font color="#660000">FPF_UseSampler</font> in the Flags 
  member of TFruityPlugInfo. A hybrid generator has less work: it just needs to 
  create a sound and FL Studio will take care of the rest. The hybrid generator 
  doesn't need to mix its voices, it's just asked by FL Studio to render each 
  voice separately in Voice_Render. </p>
