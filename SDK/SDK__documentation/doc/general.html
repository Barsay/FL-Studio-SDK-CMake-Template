<p>The FL Plugin sdk helps you to make plugins for FL Studio. For more information 
  about FL Studio, visit the website (<a href="http://www.fruityloops.com" target="_blank">www.flstudio.com</a>). 
  <br>
  Updates to and new versions of this sdk will be made available through the Developer's 
  Arena (see the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page).</p>
<p>Note that this sdk is not meant to make hosts for FL plugins. We prefer to 
  maintain complete freedom to change anything about the sdk we want at any time, 
  and this is a lot more difficult if there are 3rd party hosts that would be 
  broken by those changes.</p>
<p><b>Little intro</b><br>
  As FL Studio is created using Delphi, it's not always easy to support the latest 
  and greatest of everything right away. New programming interfaces usually come 
  only with C/C++ documentation and samples (like Windows itself, for example). 
  It takes time and some experimentation to translate the necessary headers and 
  source code from C/C++, and even then it doesn't always necessarily works completely 
  as it should. There are some nice features in C++ (macros) that can't easily 
  be translated to Delphi. So while features that add something to FL Studio 
  will be included at some time, it may take a while.<br>
  <br>
  This sdk includes Delphi files and examples, as well as files and examples for 
  C++ compilers. The C++ sources have been tested in Visual C++ (Visual Studio 
  2005).</p>
<p><b>Types of plugins</b><br>
  There are two kinds of Fruity plugins: effects and generators. Effects are plugins 
  that receive some audio data from FL Studio and do something to it (apply an 
  effect). Generators on the other hand create sounds that they send to FL Studio. 
  Generators are seen as channels by the user (like the SimSynth and Sytrus). 
  The main reason to make something a generator is that it needs input from the 
  FL Studio pianoroll (although there are other reasons possible).</p>
<p><b>Installation</b><br>
  Plugins are installed in FL Studio in subfolders of the FL Studio\Plugins\Fruity 
  folder. Effects go in the Effects subfolder, generators are installed in the 
  Generators subfolder (you're advised to use FPSetup to install your Fruity plugins). 
  Each plugin has its own folder.</p>
<p><b>Contents of the sdk</b><br>
  The sdk contains various things.<br>
  <br>
  First of all, of course, there are the files required to create plugins. These 
  can be found in the <font color="#660000">Source</font> folder. The C folder 
  contains files for C++ compilers and examples for C++Builder and Visual C++. 
  The Delphi folder contains files and examples for Delphi. <br>
  <br>
  The example plugins are also provided in compiled form, so you can try them 
  out without compiling them. The compiled dlls are contained in the <font color="#660000">Bin</font> 
  folder. To install these into FL Studio, run the install.bat file.<br>
  You'll also find the FPSetup installer program here. How this works is explained 
  in detail <a href="installation.html">over here</a>. There's also a helper plugin 
  called FruityMonitor. This is also installed by running the install.bat file 
  from the Tools folder. It's an effect plugin that shows you what happens when 
  things happen to the plugin (for example, when SaveRestoreState gets called).<br>
  <br>
  The <font color="#660000">Doc</font> folder contains this documentation. <br>
  <br>
  Note that this version of the sdk is meant for FL Studio 8 and newer. Not all 
  features will work in all versions of FL Studio.</p>
