<p>If you're going to make a generator plugin, you need to know about the voice 
  functions. <br>
  <br>
  FL Studio uses the <a href="../levelparams.html#_voiceparams">TVoiceParams</a> 
  structure to tell the plugin the settings for a certain voice. This consists 
  of two fields, InitLevels and FinalLevels, both of type <a href="../levelparams.html">TLevelParams</a>. 
  It holds information about the channel panning, volume, pitch and filter cutoff 
  and Q. Note that the Q value (FRes) has a range of 0 to 80/128. That means that 
  each value for FRes is an integer value between 0 and 80, but that needs to 
  be divided by 128 before it's assigned to FRes.</p>

        of TLevelParams has been renamed to TLevelParams_Old. Always use the new 
        version for new plugins. For old projects, you can leave the FPF_NewVoiceParams 
        out of the plugin flags (it's in the combo's by default). </font></div></td>

<p>There are four functions in <a href="../fruityplug.html">TFruityPlug</a> that 
  deal with managing voices. These are TriggerVoice, Voice_Release, Voice_Kill 
  and Voice_ProcessEvent. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>TriggerVoice</b><br>
  This is the first voice function that will get called by FL Studio. The plugin 
  has to create a new voice (allocate memory) when this is called. FL Studio provides 
  a pointer to a TVoiceParams structure. You have to keep this structure around 
  for future reference.<br>
  <br>
  The result of this function is going to be used in the other functions as the 
  identifier of the voice. It's the plugin's task to choose a unique identifier. 
  An easy way of doing this is to create a structure to hold (private) information 
  about the voice, which also holds the pointer to the TVoiceParams structure. 
  Then you can use a pointer to your own structure as the result of TriggerVoice, 
  as the pointer should be unique within a process. You can take a look at the 
  implementation of TriggerVoice in the Osc3 example for this.<br>
  <br>
  Don't forget to save the SetTag parameter. It's needed when you want to call 
  voice functions in the host class (see <a href="../fruityplughost.html">TFruityPlugHost</a>).</p>
<p>Check out the voice information codes to retrieve any relevant info about the 
  newly triggered voice. These include <font color="#660000">FPV_GetLength</font>,<font color="#660000"> 
  FPV_GetColor</font>, <font color="#660000">FPV_GetVelocity</font> and <font color="#660000">FPV_SetLinkVelocity</font>.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Voice_Release</b><br>
  This function signals that a specified voice (identified by the Handle parameter, 
  which is the value that was returned by the TriggerVoice function) should enter 
  the releasing state. This is a note off in midi terms. You can call Voice_Kill 
  in PlugHost if your generator doesn't support releasing voices. Otherwise you'll 
  probably set a flag in your voice structure and let it die out.</p>
<p>The codes <font color="#660000">FPV_GetRelVelocity</font> and <font color="#660000">FPV_GetRelTime</font> 
  can be used to retrieve more information about the released voice.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Voice_Kill</b><br>
  When FL Studio has no more need for a voice (identified by the Handle parameter), 
  it will call this function. You need to free all memory that you allocated for 
  this voice in the TriggerVoice function. <br>
  <br>
  The plugin can tell FL Studio that it wants to kill a voice. In that case, the 
  plugin shouldn't call Voice_Kill (or free any memory) itself for that voice 
  if it has called Voice_Kill in PlugHost with the KillHandle parameter set to 
  true. FL Studio will take care of calling Voice_Kill on the plugin.<br>
  <br>
  Also, make sure you kill all voices that are left when the plugin is destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Voice_ProcessEvent</b><br>
  This function will get called when a voice event occurs. The only <a href="../constants.html#_voiceeventids">voice 
  event</a> at the moment is <font color="#660000">FPV_Retrigger</font>.</p>
