<p>The host is represented by an object, just as the plugin. This makes it possible 
  to ask the host to do some things. See <a href="../fruityplughost.html">TFruityPlugHost</a> 
  for more information.</p>
<p><b>Members</b><br>
  First of all, TFruityPlugHost has some member variables that can be useful to 
  a plugin. Apart from the ones mentioned here, there are also MixingTick and 
  Flags, but they're not used yet.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">HostVersion</font> holds the version of FL Studio. All 
  the version number is included in one integer. So if the version number of FL 
  Studio would be 1.2.3, HostVersion would have a value of 01002003. Certain features 
  in the sdk require a minimum version of FL Studio to be installed.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">AppHandle</font> could be more important. It is the handle 
  of the application that has loaded the plugin (so it's the handle of FL Studio). 
  This could be needed for creating windows, depending on your development system.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">WaveTables</font> can be very handy, especially for generator 
  plugins. It's an array of maximum ten pointers to an array of samples. They 
  contain precalculated sine, triangle etc. waves. Each array has 16384 samples, 
  in floating point format (-1.0 .. +1.0). So far, only 5 wavetables are defined. 
  These are : sine (index = 0), triangle (index = 1), square (index = 2), saw 
  (index = 3), analog saw (index = 4).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">TempBuffers</font> holds a few buffers that you can use 
  when processing. They're guaranteed to hold at least Length samples (where Length 
  is the value passed to Eff_Render, Gen_Render or Voice_Render). For hybrid generators, 
  some of these buffers may be in use by FL Studio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dispatcher</b><br>
  This method sends a message to the host. You use the plugin's HostTag as the 
  Sender parameter. Check <a href="..%5Cconstants.html#_hostdispatcherids">here</a> 
  for a complete list of messages that you can send.<br>
  <br>
  First, there are two messages that are related to parameter popup menus. FL 
  Studio fills the parameter popup menu for you, but you can also add items of 
  your own if you want to. You don't necessarily have to provide a popup menu 
  for this. Anything that allows the user to choose to edit the events or link 
  to a midi controller or another of these options would do. But a popup menu 
  is more in line with other plugins in FL Studio.<br>
  <br>
  First you use <font color="#660000">FHD_GetParamMenuEntry</font> to ask the 
  host for popup menu items. The plugin then has to add these to its popup menu 
  (or whatever it chooses). Note that TDelphiFruityPlugin and TCPPFruityPlugin 
  have a function that can do this automatically, called AdjustParamPopup.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_ParamMenu</font> then informs the host that the user 
  has clicked on a parameter popup menu item. The host then reacts to this the 
  same as it does in other cases. Like this, uniformity within the program is 
  maintained. This message has two parameters. The first is the index of the parameter 
  and is passed in Index. The second is the index of the menu item that has been 
  clicked, passed in Value. This last index is counted from 0, meaning the first 
  item that was added after a call to FHD_GetParamMenyEntry. <br>
  <br>
  Note that the FL Studio popup menus also have a menu item called &quot;Reset&quot;. 
  It would be best if you also implement such an item. Since the host has nothing 
  to do with it, it won't be added by using FHD_GetParamMenuEntry.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHP_EditorResized</font> is the next host message. Call 
  this when you have resized the plugin's editor window and you want to let the 
  host know. <br>
  <br>
  Next is <font color="#660000">FHD_NoteNamesChanged</font>. It's all in the name. 
  Call this when the name of a note was changed and FL Studio will call the GetName 
  function to get the new name.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_ActivateMidi</font> is used to make the host enable 
  it's midi output (which can be disabled in FL Studio).<br>
  <br>
  Call <font color="#660000">FHD_WantMIDIInput</font> when you want your plugin 
  to receive midi messages, or to stop receiving them.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_WantMIDITick</font> means the plugin wants to receive 
  midi tick messages.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_KillAutomation</font> is called when you want the 
  host to get rid of all automation (parameter change) information that it's currently 
  holding. You want to do this when that information is no longer accurate (for 
  example the meaning of a parameter has changed) or to make a demo version (as 
  a limitation).<br>
  <br>
  If your plugin has internal presets, you have to call Dispatcher with <font color="#660000">FHD_SetNumPresets</font> 
  to let the host know how many presets there are. You can do this at any time 
  (which means you can also change the number of presets).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_SetNewName</font> can be used to change the short 
  name of the plugin while it's loaded. <br>
  <br>
  Call <font color="#660000">FHD_SelectChanSample</font> to get a selector for 
  a parent channel sample.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_WantIdle</font> lets the host know whether or not 
  the plugin wants the Idle method to be called by the host. By default this behaviour 
  is on. If you don't do anything in Idle (including showing the parameter name 
  when the mouse moves over a control), you can call this and in that way save 
  a bit of cpu power.<br>
  <br>
  Use <font color="#660000">FHD_LocateDataFile</font> when you want to find the 
  exact location for a certain file. You pass the filename without a path and 
  FL Studio will search for it in all of its search paths.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_TicksToTime</font> asks the host to translate a tick 
  time into a bar:step:tick time. <br>
  <br>
  With <font color="#660000">FHD_AddNotesToPR</font> a plugin can ask the host 
  to add one or more notes to the piano roll for the plugin's channel.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_ShowMsg </font>allows you to ask FL Studio to show 
  a message box with a certain text. This way the messagebox will look as the 
  ones FL Studio shows itself.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_NoteOn</font> and <font color="#660000">FHD_NoteOff</font> 
  allow the plugin to play a preview note on an internal piano keyboard (like 
  the Fruity DX10 does). While the plugin doesn't really need to tell the host 
  about this, it's better if it does (so the host can for example also show that 
  note playing on its preview keyboard).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_OnHint_Direct</font> is the same as OnHint, but it 
  shows the text immediately (to show a progress while you're doing something).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_SetNewColor</font> sets a new color for the parent. 
  This color is used for the sample button in FL Studio's step sequencer.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_GetInstance</font> returns the module instance of 
  the host. This could be an exe or a dll, so it might not be the process itself.<br>
  <br>
  Use <font color="#660000">FHD_KillIntCtrl</font> to ask the host to kill anything 
  linked to an internal controller, for controllers between Index &amp; Value 
  (included). This is used when getting rid of internal controllers. For example, 
  Dashboard calls this when a control is deleted.<br>
  <br>
  Call <font color="#660000">FHD_SetNumParams</font> to override the number of 
  parameters. This is useful for plugins that have a different set of parameters 
  per instance. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_PackDataFile</font> asks the host to pack an absolute 
  filename into a local filemane. When you pass the simple filename in Value the 
  packed path is returned as Result. Note that the result pointer won't be valid 
  for long, so you should copy the string right away!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_GetProgPath</font> asks the host where the FL Studio 
  engine dll is, which might NOT be where the executable is, but where the data 
  path will be. The value is returned as result of the function. Note that the 
  result pointer won't be valid for long, so you should copy the string right 
  away!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">FHD_SetLatency</font> sets the plugin latency, if any.<br>
  <br>
  Call <font color="#660000">FHD_CallDownloader</font> to show the preset downloader/selector. 
  This is for use by some specific plugins only.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>OnParamChanged</b><br>
  In order to make your parameters recordable in FL Studio, you have to call this 
  function whenever a parameter is changed from within your plugin (probably because 
  the user turned a wheel or something). You need to pass HostTag in the Sender 
  parameter. To let the host know which parameter has just been changed, pass 
  the parameter index in Index. Finally, pass the new value (as an integer) in 
  Value.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>OnHint</b><br>
  Fruity plugins can also show hints (or rather tell FL Studio to show a hint). 
  Note that <a href="../delphifruityplug.html">TDelphiFruityPlug</a> and <a href="../cppfruityplug.html">TCPPFruityPlug</a> 
  implement functions that make it a bit easier to show a hint. It's really a 
  simple function. You pass HostTag for the Sender parameter. Text is a pointer 
  to a string that contains the hint message. Note that the plugin is responsible 
  for making sure that Text points to a valid string !<br>
  <br>
  There is one extra feature of parameter hints. It is possible to tell FL Studio 
  to show little icons next to the hint, that have a special meaning. For the 
  moment there are three of those. Note that these have to be inserted at the 
  <i>BEGINNING</i> of the string.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^a&quot;</font> shows a little icon that informs 
  the user that the parameter that the hint is about can be linked to a MIDI controller.<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^b&quot;</font> informs the user that the parameter 
  is recordable. <br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^c&quot;</font> shows a little smiley. No real use, 
  just for fun.<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^d&quot;</font> shows a mouse with the right button 
  clicked, to denote a control that has a popup menu.<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^e&quot;</font> shows an unhappy smiley, to use 
  when something went wrong.<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^f&quot;</font> shows a left-pointing arrow<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^g&quot;</font> shows a double right-pointing arrow, 
  for fast forward<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^h&quot;</font> is an exclamation mark, for a warning 
  to the user<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^i&quot;</font> is an hourglass<br>
  <font color="#660000">&quot;^j&quot;</font> shows a double left-pointing arrow, 
  for fast reverse<br>
  <br>
  So to show both the &quot;midi linkable&quot; and &quot;recordable&quot; icons, 
  you might have a hint like this : &quot;^b^aThis is my hint&quot;. Note that 
  in FL Studio the order is reversed (not ^a^b, but ^b^a). You might want to do 
  this too in order to fit in better.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>LockMix / UnlockMix</b><br>
  These two functions work together. They are here to let you control the different 
  threads within FL Studio in case they would get in your way. Working with threads 
  is not a very easy subject and can cause many problems. <br>
  <br>
  FL Studio has a seperate thread for the mixer. So functions inside the plugin 
  could be called from the main thread or from the mix thread. Multiple functions 
  within your plugin could be executing at the same time! Therefore if you have 
  to do something that could be disturbed by this, first call Lockmix. After this, 
  you can do whatever it is you want to do. When you're done, <b>DON'T FORGET</b> 
  to call UnlockMix. This let's the mixer thread go about its business again.<br>
  <br>
  It's also essential to implement as little code as possible between the calls 
  to LockMix and UnlockMix. When the locking lasts too long a time, this will 
  disrupt the playing in FL Studio, ranging from clicks to delays (zipper noise).</p>
<p>Note that there are two other pairs of locking functions: <font color="#660000">LockPlugin</font>/<font color="#660000">UnlockPlugin</font> 
  (won't freeze audio) and <font color="#660000">LockMix_Shared</font>/<font color="#660000">UnlockMix_Shared</font> 
  (multithread-safe processing).</p>
