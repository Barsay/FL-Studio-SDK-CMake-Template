  This is the unit that contains the plugin class definition and implementation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  First we have the uses section.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td><pre><font color="#3333FF">unit <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain; <br>
interface <br>  <br>uses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FP_Def, FP_PlugClass, FP_DelphiPlug, ActiveX, Forms, Editor;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here we include the sdk units (FP_Def, FP_PlugClass and FP_DelphiPlug). We 
  also include the ActiveX unit, as it defines the IStream interface which is 
  used in SaveRestoreState. The last unit (Editor) contains the editor form (more 
  about that later).<br>
  <br>
  Next we define some useful constants. This is not necessary, but it can make 
  life a lot easier when you start changing these values. FruityGain has a seperate 
  gain value for the left and right channels, so we have two parameters. There 
  are also a minimum and maximum value defined.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td><pre><font color="#3333FF">const <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#9999FF">// the number of parameters</font><font color="#0000CC">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#9999FF">// the parameter indexes</font> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prmGainLeft = 0; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prmGainRight = 1; <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#9999FF">// minimum and maximum values of the gain parameters</font> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GainMinimum = 0; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GainMaximum = 20; <br>
<font color="#9999FF">// the information structure describing this plugin to the host</font> <br>var <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; PlugInfo : TFruityPlugInfo = ( <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDKVersion : CurrentSDKVersion;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LongName : 'FruityGain_D'; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShortName : 'F.Gain D'; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flags : FPF_Type_Effect; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NumParams : NumParams; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DefPoly : 0 <font color="#9999FF">// infinite</font> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;);</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Then we also declare a new variable of type TFruityPlugInfo. This record will 
  be read by FL Studio later on to find out what kind of plugin this is. We 
  set <b>SDKVersion</b> to the constant value CurrentSDKVersion, so FL Studio 
  knows what we expect from it. <br>
  We also set <b>LongName</b> to the name of the dll, without the .dll extension. 
  The name of the dll should be as unique as possible. So simply 'Gain' would 
  have been a bad name, whereas 'XFIGOEJSL' might be a good unique name, but probably 
  not very nice to the user. You might use something like 'Ralfs Gain' for example 
  as the name of your plugin, which would make it reasonably unique.<br>
  <b>ShortName</b> can be anything you want, but it should also be as unique as 
  possible. It also shouldn't be very long (as the name suggests).<br>
  <b>Flags</b> actually defines what kind of plugin we're creating. We're making 
  an effect plugin, so we use FPF_Type_Effect. There are some other flags you 
  can use here too (see <a href="../constants.html#_pluginflags">Plugin Flag Constants</a>).<br>
  We tell FL Studio how many parameters we have in <b>NumParams</b>. We also 
  set <b>DefPoly</b> to 0, as we're creating an effect plugin.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> We're now ready to declare the plugin class. Note that we're deriving from 
  TDelphiFruityPlug. This class implements some useful functions so it's not a 
  bad idea to derive from this instead of TFruityPlug. For example, TDelphiFruityPlug 
  implements DestroyObject in order to call Free, so you don't have to do this 
  anymore. <br>
  <br>
  Here we first have some variables in which we store the parameter values. We 
  have both integer and floating point variables for this. The integer variables 
  are for communication with the editor controls (which use integers) and the 
  floating point ones are for calculations in Eff_Render (so we don't have to 
  calculate them every time Eff_Render is called).</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre> <font color="#3333FF">type <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TFruityGain = class(TDelphiFruityPlug)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedure ResetParams; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end;</font></pre>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Then we define a constructor. This has one parameter, Tag, that is passed on 
  from the host. We'll get back to this when we discuss the implementation of 
  the constructor. We could also have overridden DestroyObject if we wanted to 
  do something special when that is called by FL Studio. But since we derive 
  from TDelphiFruityPlug, DestroyObject is already implemented to free the object, 
  so we don't need to do that anymore.<br>
  The rest of the functions defined will be discussed when we reach their implementation. 
  Just a little note here that GainIntToSingle and ResetParams are helper functions 
  for this specific plugin, so they probably won't be present in your own plugins.<br>
  <br>
  The last declaration in the interface section is CreatePlugInstance. This is 
  a very important function. It is exported from the dll and called by FL Studio 
  to create an instance of the class. Note that it's declared stdcall.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">function CreatePlugInstance(Host: TFruityPlugHost; Tag: Integer): TFruityPlug; stdcall;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>So we reach the implementation, with some more used units.<br>
</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">implementation <br>   <br>uses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SysUtils, Controls, Windows;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We begin by implementing CreatePlugInstance. First we assign Host to the global 
  variable PlugHost. This is necessary, as some functions in TDelphiFruityPlug 
  expect it to be there. Then we create our plugin object and pass it back to 
  FL Studio as the result of the function.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">function CreatePlugInstance(Host: TFruityPlugHost; Tag: Integer): TFruityPlug; 
begin <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;PlugHost := Host; <br>&nbsp; Result := TFruityGain.Create(Tag); <br>end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Now we reach the implementation of the constructor. The first thing we do of 
  course is call the inherited constructor. <br>
  We also assign the address of the PlugInfo variable we declared earlier to the 
  Info member of TFruityPlug. This way, FL Studio knows where to find it.<br>
  Then we assign the Tag parameter (passed by CreatePlugInstance) to the HostTag 
  member, so we can use it later on. </p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#9999FF">{ TFruityGain }</font><font color="#3333FF"> <br>constructor TFruityGain.Create(Tag: integer); 
begin 
  inherited Create; 

  Info := @PlugInfo; 
  HostTag := Tag; 

  EditorForm := TEditorForm.Create(nil); 
  with TEditorForm(EditorForm) do 
  begin 
    Plugin := Self; 
    LeftGainTrack.Min := GainMinimum; 
    LeftGainTrack.Max := GainMaximum; 
    RightGainTrack.Min := GainMinimum; 
    RightGainTrack.Max := GainMaximum; 
  end; 

  ResetParams; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We also create our editor form in the constructor. After we've done this, we 
  set some of its variables (discussed later when we reach Editor.pas).<br>
  Finally, we reset the parameter values. ResetParams is used for this, as resetting 
  the parameters is done from several places.</p>
<p>Next is Dispatcher. This function passes messages from FL Studio to the plugin. 
  These are identified by the ID parameter (for a list of all values, see <a href="../constants.html#_dispatcherid">Dispatcher 
  ID's</a>). The Index and Value parameters have different meanings, depending 
  on the value of ID.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">function TFruityGain.Dispatcher(ID, Index, Value: Integer): Integer; 
begin 
  Result := 0; 

  case ID of 
    // show the editor 
    FPD_ShowEditor: 
      begin 
        if Value = 0 then 
        begin 
          EditorForm.Hide; 
          EditorForm.ParentWindow := 0; 
        end 
        else 
        begin 
          EditorForm.ParentWindow := Value; 
          EditorForm.Show; 
        end; 

        EditorHandle := EditorForm.Handle; 
      end; 
  end; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here we implement a reaction to the FPD_ShowEditor message. This tells us that 
  FL Studio wants the editor form to be either hidden or shown, depending on 
  the value of Value. Value holds the parent window we have to use to show our 
  editor form. <br>
  So if Value is zero, we hide the window, and then we set the parent window to 
  zero. <br>
  If Value is not zero, we assign it to ParentWindow for our editor, and then 
  we show the editor. <br>
  Note that the order of these things is important. If ParentWindow is zero while 
  the editor form is already or still shown, the user will see it floating on 
  the screen, which doesn't make a good impression.<br>
  Finally we set TFruityPlug's EditorHandle member to the handle of our editor 
  form. </p>
<p> Eff_Render is the core of an effect plugin. It gets called continuously to 
  process data while the plugin is active. <br>
  Data is to be read from SourceBuffer, processed, and written to DestBuffer. 
  These two parameters point to a buffer of interlaced samples. Interlaced means 
  that the samples for the two channels (left and right) are mixed together. So 
  first you get the first left sample, then the first right sample, then the second 
  left sample and so on. <br>
  Note that SourceBuffer and DestBuffer could point to the same buffer, so it 
  might be worth checking for this to save some time.<br>
  The PWAV32FS type makes it easy to work with these buffers, as shown in below.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">procedure TFruityGain.Eff_Render(SourceBuffer, DestBuffer: PWAV32FS; Length: Integer); 
var 
   left, right : single; 
   i : integer; 
begin 
  left := GainLeft; 
  right := GainRight; 

  for i := 0 to Length-1 do 
  begin 
    DestBuffer^[i, 0] := SourceBuffer^[i, 0] * left; 
    DestBuffer^[i, 1] := SourceBuffer^[i, 1] * right; 
  end; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We first assign GainLeft and GainRight to some local variables, in case they 
  change while we're processing.<br>
  Then we run through the buffers, each time multiplying the channel's gain with 
  the current sample. As you can see, Length specifies the number of samples in 
  each channel, not the total amount of samples in the buffer.</p>
<p>GainIntToSingle is a function specific to this plugin. It translates the integer 
  parameter values (from the editor controls) to floating point values. What's 
  important here is that we lock and unlock the mixing threads, to make sure that 
  this doesn't happen from two threads at the same time, or that other functions 
  that depend on these values are called from a different thread. It's probably 
  a bit overkill in this example, but it shows how to do it.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">procedure TFruityGain.GainIntToSingle; 
begin 
  <font color="#9999FF">// for safety when we update the actual value, we lock the mixing thread</font> 
  Lock; 
  try 
    GainLeft := (GainLeftInt / 4) + 1; 
    GainRight := (GainRightInt / 4) + 1; 
  finally 
    Unlock; <font color="#9999FF">// and unlock it again when we're through (very important !)</font> 
  end; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Next is the implementation of GetName. This procedure is called by FL Studio 
  when it wants a string representation of some value. What it wants translated 
  is specified by the Section parameter (see <a href="../constants.html#_getname">GetName 
  constants</a>). The meanings of Index and Value depend on the value of Section. 
  Name points to a buffer that you have to put the translated string into. The 
  memory for Name is assigned by FL Studio, so you don't need to worry about 
  this. There's room for at least 256 characters in Name.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">procedure TFruityGain.GetName(Section, Index, Value: Integer; Name: PChar);
var
   tempsingle : single;
begin
  if Section = FPN_Param then
  begin
    case Index of
      prmGainLeft  :  StrPCopy(Name, 'Left Gain');
      prmGainRight :  StrPCopy(Name, 'Right Gain');
    end;
  end
  else if Section = FPN_ParamValue then
  begin
    tempsingle := (Value / 4) + 1;
    StrPCopy(Name, Format('%.2fx', [tempsingle]));
  end; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF">
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We check for two Section values here : FPN_Param (a parameter name is required) 
  and FPN_ParamValue (a parameter value is to be translated). In both cases, Index 
  tells us what parameter FL Studio is talking about. In the case of FPN_ParamValue, 
  Value holds the value to be translated. Don't use your own internal values for 
  this, since it's not always the current value that has to be translated.</p>
<p>Next is the Idle procedure. You can use this to perform some action when the 
  user isn't doing anything. In this example, we do something very nice which 
  you might want to implement in your own plugins as well. We check whether the 
  mouse is over a control (on our editor form of course) and tell FL Studio 
  to show a hint message.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">procedure TFruityGain.Idle; 
var 
   Control : TControl; 
   P : TPoint; 
begin 
  if (GetCaptureControl <> nil) then 
    Exit; 

  GetCursorPos(P); 
  Control := FindDragTarget(P, true); 
  if (Control <> nil) then 
  begin 
    if AppHint <> Control.Hint then 
    begin 
      AppHint := Control.Hint; 
      PlugHost.OnHint(HostTag, PChar(AppHint)); 
    end; 
  end; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>It's important to know here that we assigned values to the Hint properties 
  of all controls on the editor form. We use the global AppHint variable to check 
  if the hint is already being shown or not. If not, we call OnHint on the host 
  object (saved in CreatePlugInstance) to let FL Studio show a hint in its own 
  way. </p>
<p>Now we come to the ProcessParam function. This is a bit complicated, so I'll 
  split it up into several parts.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">function TFruityGain.ProcessParam(Index, Value, RECFlags: Integer): Integer; 
begin 
  if Index < NumParams then with TEditorForm(EditorForm) do 
  begin 
    if RECFlags and REC_FromMIDI <> 0 then 
      Value := TranslateMIDI(Value, GainMinimum, GainMaximum); </font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>First we check whether Index actually identifies a valid parameter. <br>
  Then we start checking the flags present in RECFlags. The order in which we 
  check these is important. We start by checking for REC_FromMIDI. This means 
  that Value holds a value between 0 and 65536, that needs to be translated to 
  the range for our parameter. How this happens depends on the minimum and maximum 
  values of the individual parameters. Since our parameters have the same minimum 
  and maximum, we don't need to check Index. TDelphiFruityPlug provides the function 
  TranslateMIDI, so you don't need to implement this yourself. <br>
  <br>
  Next we check whether we need to change the value of a parameter to a new value 
  or return a parameter value to FL Studio.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">    if RECFlags and REC_UpdateValue <> 0 then 
    begin 
      case Index of 
        prmGainLeft  : GainLeftInt := Value; 
        prmGainRight : GainRightInt := Value; 
      end; 
      GainIntToSingle; 
    end </font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If RECFlags includes REC_UpdateValue, we need to change a parameter's value. 
  So we check Index to see which parameter we have to change and set the value. 
  In this example, GainIntToSingle is called to also set the floating point values.<br>
  Note that we're not changing the controls on the editor form yet. That's for 
  a bit later.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">    else if RECFlags and REC_GetValue <> 0 then 
      case Index of 
        prmGainLeft  : Value := GainLeftInt; 
        prmGainRight : Value := GainRightInt; 
      end; </font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If REC_GetValue is in RECFlags, FL Studio expects us to return the value 
  of a parameter as the result of the function. This flag cannot be present when 
  REC_UpdateValue is present, so we use an if .. then .. else construct. We look 
  at Index to know which parameter FL Studio is talking about and change Value 
  to the integer value of the parameter.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#3333FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">    if RECFlags and REC_UpdateControl <> 0 then 
      ParamsToControls; 
  end; 

  Result := Value; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The final check we make is for REC_UpdateControl. When this is not present, 
  don't update the editor form's controls ! We call ParamsToControls, which is 
  a function of our TEditorForm class (see below when we discuss Editor.pas). 
  This updates all parameters, but since we only have two, this isn't too bad. 
  If you have a lot of controls to update, it would be better to just update the 
  parameter identified by Index.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the function, we assign Value to Result. It's safe to always do 
  this, regardless of whether or not REC_GetValue is present in RECFlags.</p>
<p>Time to move on to the next function.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1" bordercolor="#0000FF">
  <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF"> 
    <td>
      <pre><font color="#3333FF">procedure TFruityGain.ResetParams; 
begin 
  <font color="#9999FF">// start with a gain of 1.5 of both channels</font> 
  GainLeftInt := 2; 
  GainRightInt := 2; 

  GainIntToSingle; <font color="#9999FF">// translate the int gain to floating point value</font> 
  TEditorForm(EditorForm).ParamsToControls; 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>ResetParams is an internal function to reset the parameters to their default 
  values. Here, we also call GainIntToSingle to set the floating point variables 
  and ParamsToControls to update the editor's controls.</p>
<p>Then comes SaveRestoreState. This function allows the plugin to write its state 
  to and read it from a stream, which could be a file, or memory, or whatever. 
  The Save parameter tells us whether FL Studio expects the plugin to save or 
  restore.<br>
  The Stream parameter is of type IStream. You can use this just like any object. 
  There are several functions available in IStream, but the most important are 
  Write and Read. One thing to watch out for, is that you have to read the exact 
  same amount of data from the stream as was written to this. For simple plugins, 
  you can do this simply by reading and writing the same data. For more complex 
  plugins, it might be necessary to first write the amount of data you're going 
  to write, or some sort of version number, so that you never make a mistake.</p>

<p>First we check Save, so we know what to do. IStream.Write and IStream.Read 
  work similarly. The first parameter is a pointer to the data to write away. 
  Here, we use a temporary variable (templong) and pass its address using the 
  @ operator. The second parameter is the size of the data to be written, which 
  we find by using SizeOf. The last parameter is a pointer to a longint. In the 
  case of Write, this will hold the number of bytes which were actually written 
  to the stream. In the case of Read, this will hold the number of bytes actually 
  read from the stream. After reading, we also update the parameters and controls 
  by calling GainIntToSingle and ProcessAllParams.</p>
<p>And so we reach the end of the Gain.pas unit.</p>

<p><a name="_editor"></a><b>Editor.pas</b><br>
  This unit contains our editor form. <br>
  Make sure you set the BorderStyle property of your editor form to bsNone, as 
  the editor form will be placed inside another window. <br>
  There are two controls : LeftGainTrack and RightGainTrack, both trackbars, which 
  represent the parameters. There's also a popupmenu.</p>

<p>We add a variable called Plugin to the form class, to be able to communicate 
  with the plugin about parameter changes. The we define two functions. ControlsToParams 
  gets called to set a parameter after a control has changed. ParamsToControls 
  sets the control values after the parameters have changed.</p>
<p>The first function to discuss is ControlsToParams.</p>

<p>We set the plugin's parameters, depending on which changed, to the new value. 
  Then we call PlugHost.OnParamChanged, to let FL Studio know there's been a 
  change. Finally, we call GainIntToSingle on the plugin to also set the floating 
  point parameter values. </p>
<p>ParamsToControls gets called by the plugin when it's parameter values have 
  changed and the controls have to be updated. This allows the plugin to know 
  nothing of what kind of controls are used to represent the parameters.</p>

<p>GainTrackChange is the event handler for LeftGainTrack.OnChange and RightGainTrack.OnChange.</p>

    ShowHintMsg(PChar(s));

end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We do two things here. First, we call ControlsToParams to change the plugin 
  parameter variables. C.Tag is 0 for LeftGainTrack and 1 for RightGainTrack. 
  <br>
  The second thing we do is let FL Studio show a hint. Depending on the parameter 
  index (left gain = 0, right gain = 1), we format a string with the right parameter 
  value. Then we call ShowHintMsg, a method defined in TDelphiFruityPlug to tell 
  FL Studio what to do.</p>
<p>Next, PopupClick. This is the event handler for most items of the Popup popupmenu 
  (all except the Reset item and the breaks). Take a look at this popupmenu in 
  Delphi. The items (except Reset and the breaks) all have special values for 
  Tag. These correspond to the <a href="../constants.html#_parampopupindexes">Parameter 
  Popup Menu Indexes</a>. InPopupClick, we tell FL Studio to perform a certain 
  action (show the event editor, for example).</p>

  PlugHost.Dispatcher(Plugin.HostTag, FHD_ParamMenu, Comp.Tag, Menu.Tag); 
end;</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We retrieve the component that the popupmenu was show over from the PopupComponent 
  property. Then we call the Dispatcher on PlugHost with the dispatcher flag (FHD_ParamMenu), 
  the parameter indes (Comp.Tag) and the menu item index (Menu.Tag).</p>
<p>mnuResetClick is the event handler for the Reset item of the Popup popupmenu. 
  We simply call ResetParams on the plugin object.</p>

  This is the project file. It's important to us here for one thing : exporting 
  CreatePlugInstance. Don't forget to do this, as otherwise your plugin won't 
  be loaded by FL Studio.</p>
